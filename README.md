# Purpose of the research: 
This project aims to develop a philosophy of Open Science [OS] that (1) emphasises the 
diversity of research environments around the world; (2) articulates the conditions under 
which OS can leverage such diversity to promote good research practice; and (3) supports OS 
governance, by providing a framework that fosters research quality, inclusivity and 
fairness. The Open Science [OS] movement is transforming research, with OS policies 
adopted around the globe and wide consensus on implementing principles like transparency 
and reproducibility. However, the philosophy underpinning the OS movement has not been 
clearly articulated. Implementing OS across different settings also carries risks, such as the 
marginalisation of contributions from low-resourced environments. This raises questions 
about the relation between open and good science. To address these concerns, this 
project combines a philosophical analysis of research conditions with empirical research on 
how different environments enact and conceptualise OS. We also collaborate with 
institutions involved in OS implementation, to help articulate and monitor how OS can boost 
research without having a negative impact.
